#Write a class called Product. The class should have fields called name,amount,
#and price,holding the productâ€™s name, the number of items of that product in stock, and the regular price
#of the product. There  should  be a method get_price that receives the
#number of items to be bought and returns the cost of buying that many items,
#where the regular price is charged for orders of less than 10 items,
#a 10% discount is applied for orders of between 10 and 99 items,
#and a 20% discount is applied for orders of 100 or more items.
#There should also be a method called make_purchase that receives the number
#of items to be bought and decreases amount by that much.
