#(a)  Write a program that asks the user to enter a
#sentence and then randomly rearranges thewords of the
#sentence. Donâ€™t worry about getting punctuation or
#capitalization correct.
#(b)  Do the above problem, but now make sure that the sentence
#starts with a capital, thatthe original first word is not capitalized if
#it comes in the middle of the sentence, andthat the period is in
#the right place.
