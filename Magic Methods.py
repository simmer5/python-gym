"""
__add__ for +
__sub__ for -
__mul__ for *
__truediv__ for /
__floordiv__ for //
__mod__ for %
__pow__ for **
__and__ for &
__xor__ for ^
__or__ for |

The expression x + y is translated into x.__add__(y).
However, if x hasn't implemented __add__, and x and y are of different types, then y.__radd__(x) is called.
There are equivalent r methods for all magic methods just mentioned.

===============================

Python also provides magic methods for comparisons.
__lt__ for <
__le__ for <=
__eq__ for ==
__ne__ for !=
__gt__ for >
__ge__ for >=

If __ne__ is not implemented, it returns the opposite of __eq__.
There are no other relationships between the other operators.

===========================================

There are several magic methods for making classes act like containers.
__len__ for len()
__getitem__ for indexing
__setitem__ for assigning to indexed values
__delitem__ for deleting indexed values
__iter__ for iteration over objects (e.g., in for loops)
__contains__ for in

There are many other magic methods that we won't cover here, 
such as __call__ for calling objects as functions, 
and __int__, __str__, and the like, for converting objects to built-in types.

__del__ for del
__repr__ used for string representation of the instance
