#The following is useful in implementing computer
#players in a number of different games. Write a program
#that creates a5Ã—5 list consisting of zeroes and ones.
#Your program should then pick a random location in the
#list that contains a zero and change it to a one.
#If all the entries are one, the program should say so.
#[Hint: one way to do this is to create a new list whose
#items are the coordinates of all the ones in the list and
#use the choice method to randomly select one.
#Use a two-element list to represent a set of coordinates.]
